This plugin enables the export of issue, article, galley and supplementary file metadata in Onix for DOI (O4DOI) format and 
the registration of DOIs with the mEDRA registration agency.

This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file COPYING for the

System Requirements
-------------------
Same requirements as the OJS 2.4 core.

Note
---------
In order to register DOIs with mEDRA from within OJS you will have to enter your username and password. 
If you do not enter or have your own username and password you'll still be able to export into the 
Onix for DOI (O4DOI) format, but you cannot register your DOIs from within OJS.
Please note, that the passowrd will be saved as plain text, i.e. not encripted, due to mEDRA registration service requirements.
